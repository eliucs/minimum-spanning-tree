## Minimum Spanning Tree Demonstration

This is a demonstration in Node.js of Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm
to find the minimum spanning tree of a set of vertices. Graphics use the
Paper.js library.

A [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
is a subset of edges of a weighted undirected graph such that it connects
all vertices but with the minimum combined edge weight.
